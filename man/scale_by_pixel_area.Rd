\title{Scales a raster by the area of each pixel in meters}
\usage{
scale_by_pixel_area(x, filename, datatype, pixel_areas = NULL,
  scale_factor = 1)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{a \code{Raster*} object}

\item{filename}{(optional) filename for output raster}

\item{datatype}{(optional) datatype for output raster see 
\code{\link{dataType}} NOT YET SUPPORTED}

\item{pixel_areas}{a vector giving the area of each cell in a single column 
of the raster. See \code{\link{calc_pixel_areas}}. If NULL, this vector will 
be calculated based on the coordinate system of \code{x}.}

\item{scale_factor}{a value to scale the results by}
}
\value{
\code{RasterLayer} with pixel areas (in meters)
}
\description{
Calculates the area (in meters) of each pixel in a raster, scales the value 
of each pixel by the area, applies the desired scale factor, and returns the 
result as a \code{RasterLayer}.  Useful for calculating class areas based on 
a classified raster in a geographic coordinate system.  Assumes that raster 
is not rotated (latitudes of every pixel in a given row are identical).  
Processes block by block to support handling very large rasters.
